Statistical Process Control (SPC) methods and charts are an alternative to common red, amber, green
visualisations found in many corporate performance report suites.

The aim is to more clearly visualise change over time and also to differentiate 
between between common cause and special cause variation.

What we want to do is help managers and front line staff __see the woods for the trees__.

### An example in R using the qicharts2 ```r emo::ji("package")```

```{r}
dataset <- read_csv("data/ready_for_care.csv")

since_date <- as.Date("2015-07-01")

qic(x = Month, 
    y = RFC,
    chart = "i",
    data = filter(dataset, Month >= since_date),
    title = "Control Chart - Elective Surgery Waiting List",
    subtitle = "Red line is the mean over the period.\nGreen line is target. \nShaded area is the range of expected random variation",
    xlab = "",
    ylab = "Patients Waiting",
    caption = str_glue("Monthly data from {format(since_date, '%B %Y')} to {format(max(dataset$Month), '%B %Y')} ")
    )   +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 1995 , color = "green")

```

**Some good reasons to use SPC are** 

- SPC alerts us to a situation that may be deteriorating
- SPC shows us if a situation is improving
- SPC shows us how capable a system is of delivering a standard or target
- SPC shows us if a process that we depend on is reliable and in control.

**Here are some great resources**
