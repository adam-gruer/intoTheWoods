Statistical Process Control (SPC) methods and charts are an alternative to common red, amber, green
visualisations found in many corporate performance report suites.

The aim is to more clearly visualise change over time and also to differentiate 
between between common cause and special cause variation.

What we want to do is help managers and front line staff __see the woods for the trees__.  Help them focus on areas where performance is improving or deteriorating outside
the range that could normally be expected.


### An example in R using the qicharts2 ```r emo::ji("package")```


```{r}
dataset <- read_csv("data/ready_for_care.csv")

since_date <- as.Date("2015-07-01")

qic(x = Month, 
    y = RFC,
    chart = "i",
    data = filter(dataset, Month >= since_date),
    title = "Control Chart - Ready for Care ESIS Waiting List",
    subtitle = "Red line is the mean over the period. \nShaded area is the range of expected random variation",
    xlab = "",
    ylab = "Patients Waiting",
    caption = str_glue("Monthly data from {format(since_date, '%B %Y')} to {format(max(dataset$Month), '%B %Y')} ")
    )   +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 1995 , color = "black")

```
